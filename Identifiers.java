        //Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
        //Names must begin with a letter
        //Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
        //Names can also begin with $ and _ 
        //Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
        //Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
